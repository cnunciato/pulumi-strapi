# pulumi-strapi

An example that deploys [Strapi CMS](https://strapi.io/) as a containerized web app on AWS with [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/).

* Deploys in a [VPC](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/) (with public and private subnets) with [ECS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) and [Elastic Load Balancing](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/)
* Forwards logs to [CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/), streams CloudWatch logs to your terminal
* Supports both [RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) MySQL and PostgreSQL (with PostgreSQL as the default)
* Stores your media (e.g., Strapi uploads) with [Amazon EFS](https://aws.amazon.com/efs/)
* Supports custom domains and SSL certs with [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) and [ACM](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/)
* Deploy from your laptop, in CI (e.g., GitHub Actions), or with [Pulumi Deployments](https://www.pulumi.com/product/pulumi-deployments/)
* Everything written in TypeScript

```

[![Deploy with Pulumi](https://get.pulumi.com/new/button.svg)](https://app.pulumi.com/new?template=https://github.com/cnunciato/pulumi-strapi)

## Handy local commands

```bash
# Install Strapi and Pulumi dependencies.
make ensure

# Develop locally -- build content types, etc. -- using the SQLite backend.
make serve

# Create a new Pulumi stack (e.g., `dev`).
make new-stack

# Deploy!
make deploy

# Browse to your newly deployed Strapi CMS.
make browse

# Stream CloudWatch logs to your terminal.
make logs

# When you're done, tear everything down.
make destroy
```

See the `Makefile` for details.
